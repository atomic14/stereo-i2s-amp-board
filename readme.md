# Overview

This is a version of the Adafruit MAX98537 amplifier board, but with stereo output. It uses two MAX98357 ICs, one for the left channel and one for the right channel.

The board should be pretty much the same size as the Adafruit board, but the mounting holes are slightly smaller due to lack of space.

Pin out is the same, but you will have to take the SD line high to enable the output. Taking the SD line low will put the ICs into low power mode.
